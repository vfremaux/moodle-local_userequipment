# moodle-local_userequipment
Provides a per user setup of available plugins as self equipment of the user. (Needs patchs).

====== Install the patchs ========

Needed Patchs are packaged into a standard dual meta directory to help integrators to process
automated patch integration. 

__patch directory contains the patched files that are used for the current version of Moodle. Patched
files are given into a consistant relative path from moodle root installation. 

__reference directory contains original core files that were used originally when patch has been
designed. Reference files are given with consistant relative path from moodle installation root. As
Moodle core is constantly changing more or less, the file you may have in your version may not be
exactly matching the location of the given patchs. You will use those reference files to better
identify the patch location.

To identify patchs, we use an additional // PATCH+ and // PATCH- marking. You may use the report_patches
plugin to help maintaining a patch catalog into your moodle.
In case a patch file does not have a reference counterpart, this will mean this is an additional file
that does not previously exist in core.

- diff the __patch and the __reference files to identify patch points
- report into your moodle files version
